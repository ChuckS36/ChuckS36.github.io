  <h1>My name is Charles</h1>
  <p>I am currently studying web development and enjoy learning how websites work from the inside out.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I like to explore new tech tools, build small projects, and experiment with code.</p>
  <p>I also enjoy gaming and relaxing with a good book or movie when I need to unwind.</p>
